# Overview of the Projects

## Project 1: BMI Tracker

### Objective
The BMI Tracker is a lightweight application designed to help users easily calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height and weight inputs. It aims to provide users with a quick and intuitive way to assess their health category using the BMI metric.

### Key Activities
- **User Input**: Create an interactive user interface that allows users to input their height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms).
- **BMI Calculation**: Implement the logic to compute BMI and classify it into categories such as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Display the BMI and corresponding health category upon calculation, ensuring instant feedback for users.
- **Error Handling**: Provide user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs such as non-numeric values or empty fields.
 
### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For handling the core logic behind BMI calculations.
- **Tkinter**: A Python library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI), including input fields, buttons, and labels.

## Project 2: House Price Prediction

### Objective
The House Price Prediction model is designed to estimate the median house prices in California based on selected features such as income, number of rooms, and location. This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient way to predict housing prices using a linear regression approach.

### Key Activities
- **Data Acquisition**: Utilize the California Housing dataset to gather essential features such as median income, average rooms, and geographical location (latitude and longitude) for training and testing the model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling by selecting relevant features and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- **Model Implementation**: Develop a linear regression model to predict median house values based on input features.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric and visualize the relationship between actual and predicted house prices through scatter plots.
- **Feature Selection**: Carefully choose impactful features like median income and average rooms to optimize model accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the core logic of the model and data manipulation.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the relationship between actual and predicted housing prices.
- **scikit-learn**: For model building, including linear regression and performance evaluation.
